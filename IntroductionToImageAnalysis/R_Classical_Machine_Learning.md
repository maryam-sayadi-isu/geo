## Overview

In this tutorial, we present a brief overview of classical machine learning concepts as applicable to image classification applications. In this tutorial, we will develop a classical machine learning algorithm capable of discriminating between objects present in an image. This walk through was originally written in python: [link to python version](). We have tried to maintain functionality across both languages but certain libraries/features may only be available in one or the other. The basics concepts should be the same across both.

This tutorial explores:
