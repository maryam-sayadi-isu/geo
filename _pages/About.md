# About

The Geospatial Workbook aims to be a public repository of tutorials, demonstrating geospatial analysis by walking through examples of real-world problems. It is currently in development and if you would be interested in contributing or suggesting tutorials, please contact us.

There are multiple ways to contribute to the workbook:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/geospatialworkbook) pull requests (preferred)
2. Edit online in [GitHub](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/geospatialworkbook)
3. Send a write up of the tutorial (word/markdown/script) to the Genome Informatics Facility (gifhelp AT iastate DOT edu).
